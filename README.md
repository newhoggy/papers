Sydney Paper Club
======

This is the repo for the papers and accumulated discussion notes for our meetups.

Rules...
------

Given the morally/intellectually corrupt academic publishing system we need to be super-careful where we source papers from.

* Respect licenses! - PRs will not be accepted for papers that do not allow digital distribution. Do not add papers that do not allow digital distribution! *many exclamation marks implied here*
* All papers added to the repo *must* have a provenance(unless you wrote the paper then do say so, much kudos in this case). This should be a file of the same name suffixed with .src. Follow an example.
* When you have a paper that cannot be added add the .src file pointing to where the paper may be obtained.
