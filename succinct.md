    The technological development in the field of genome research has resulted in
    a massive generation of data that has to be stored and analyzed. The enormous
    amount of information demands special data structures and algorithms for an
    efficient analysis. Such an analysis often requires the identification of
    interesting sequences in genomes, which can be realized using full-text
    indices. Until recently, the major problem of this approach was its memory
    consumption, which now can be overcome using the well known FM-index.

    Therefore, in this thesis we extended the software library SeqAn that
    provides data structures and algorithms for analyzing biological sequences,
    with sophisticated FM-index versions designed for fast and memory efficient
    pattern search. We show that in comparison with existing FM-index
    implementations our variants are not only competitive to other approaches,
    but also outperform them.
